# Guild Hitlist


![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This is a **community-maintained text file** of Discord guild (server) IDs that have been flagged for moderation purposes. The intent is to provide a centralized, transparent way to manage suspicious or policy-violating servers in tandem with bot moderation tools.

## 🧾 File Format

The `guild_hitlist.txt` file contains one guild ID per line:

123456789012345678
987654321098765432
...


## ✅ Use Cases

- Automated moderation bots
- Community safety enforcement
- Preventing re-joins from previously banned servers

## 🚫 Rules for Contribution

- **Do not** add a server just because you dislike it.
- You must include a reason in the PR/commit message.
- IDs must be verifiable and should not come from private servers unless clear harm is documented.

## 📬 Contributing

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add new server IDs to `guild_hitlist.txt`.
3. Create a pull request with a short note (e.g., "Added server involved in raid behavior").
4. Wait for review/merge.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational and moderation use only. It **must not** be used for harassment, stalking, or brigading. Misuse may result in your PR being rejected and your account being reported to GitHub and Discord Trust & Safety.
