# Contributing to Guild Hitlist 🛡️

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this community moderation tool. Here's how you can help and the guidelines to follow.

## 📥 Submitting Guild IDs

Before submitting any server IDs, please make sure you:

1. **Verify the Reason**  
   Guilds must be flagged based on:
   - Verified raids or hate speech
   - Harmful or malicious content
   - Known participation in brigading or ban evasion

2. **Check for Duplicates**  
   Don’t submit an ID already listed.

3. **Format Properly**  
   - One guild ID per line
   - No commas, trailing whitespace, or inline comments

Example:

123456789012345678
876543210987654321


4. **Use Clear PR Titles**  
   Good: `Add known raid group server ID`  
   Bad: `Added a server I don’t like`

## 🔍 Optional but Recommended

- Provide a short description in the PR or commit message.
- Link a source (screenshot, report, or context).
- Be transparent — no one should feel this is a personal blacklist.

---

## 🛑 What NOT to Do

- Don’t add servers because of simple personal disagreements.
- Don’t submit private server IDs without clear justification.
- Don’t misuse this list for harassment, brigading, or doxing.

- Build automation (e.g., update bots, PFP flagging tools).
- Help review pull requests.
